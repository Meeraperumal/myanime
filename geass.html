            <blockquote>
                <p class="pa">In 2010, the Britannian Empire enslaved Japan using powerful mecha known as Knightmares;
                    in the aftermath Japan was renamed Area 11, and its people began a hard and terrible existence.
                    Lelouch, a Britannian student living in Area 11, has grown up hating the Empire and everything it
                    stands for. One day, in the middle of a terrorist attack, Lelouch meets a mysterious girl who grants
                    him the ability to control minds. Can he use his new power to fight for freedom, or will his hatred
                    twist his good intentions into mindless acts of vengeance?

                <p class="pa">Drawn to the mystique of the unknown, Hunters travel the world in search of terrifying
                    creatures, incredible riches, and unexplored lands. Gon Freecss is a naive-yet-determined young boy
                    who aspires to join the ranks of these individuals, in order to find his missing father Ging - a
                    master of the profession himself. To reach his goal, he partakes in the formidable Hunter Exam, a
                    series of tests that push the participants to their physical and mental limits, with a Hunter
                    License as the prize. During the exam Gon befriends vengeful Kurapika, doctor-to-be Leorio, and
                    skilled assassin Killua, who have entered for their own reasons. But with the sinister Hisoka
                    standing in their way, will Gon and his friends be able to succeed in obtaining their reward, or
                    even escaping with their lives?

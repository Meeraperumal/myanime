            <blockquote><p class="pa">Two and a half years have passed since the end of Naruto’s old adventures. He has trained hard with Jiraiya-sama and has returned to Konoha to reunite with his friends; but Akatsuki, the organization that threatened Naruto years before, is on the move again and this time Naruto is not the only one in danger. With the powerful Akatsuki organization looming ahead of him, Sasuke still missing, and the struggle with the beast hidden inside him a continuous battle, will Naruto's hard-earned improvements be enough? Join Naruto, Sakura, new friends and the rest of the old gang as the action heats up with new techniques and stronger enemies.

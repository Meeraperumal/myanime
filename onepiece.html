            <blockquote>
                <p class="pa">Long ago the infamous Gol D. Roger was the strongest and most powerful pirate on the seas.
                    As he was about to be executed he revealed that he hid all of his wealth, including the legendary
                    treasure known as One Piece, on an island at the end of the Grand Line - a treacherous and truly
                    unpredictable sea. Monkey D. Luffy is a spirited, energetic and somewhat dim-witted young man with a
                    very big dream: to find One Piece and become the Pirate King! However Luffy is no ordinary boy, as
                    when he was younger he ate one of the Devil's Fruits and gained its power to become a Rubber Man.
                    Now in this grand age of pirates Luffy sets out to gather a crew and sail to the most dangerous sea
                    in the world so that he can fulfill his dream... and maybe even his appetite!

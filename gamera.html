            <blockquote>
                <p class="pa">Gamera is a fearless and heroic monster, who protects Boco and his friends no matter his
                    pain. He is shown to be willing to both sustain heavy injuries and sacrifice himself for the saftey
                    of the children. He is a very brutal and fierce combatant, utilizing his abilities and overall
                    physical strength to overpower, throw, dismember, and maim his opponents. Gamera is also very
                    intelligent, discerning exactly where the Foundation's Moon base was located, as well as that it was
                    the root of the kaiju plaguing humanity and needed to be destroyed.

                <p class="pa">
                    Over a century ago, mankind was devoured by giant beings of unknown intelligence and origin known as
                    Titans â€“ creatures that eat humans alive indiscriminately and for no apparent reason. The remaining
                    population has managed to survive the last hundred years only by building a multi-walled city
                    capable of keeping the Titans at bay, training military recruits to patrol the perimeter and gather
                    intelligence about their mysterious foe. Eren and Mikasa have lived a relatively peaceful life
                    behind the city's walls, but when a massive Titan appears, smashing the outer barrier and unleashing
                    a wave of terror, their lives are brutally changed forever..
